First_Yes_DOY,"The day of year, ranging from 1 to 366, of the first ""yes"" record of the series.",
First_Yes_Julian_Date,"The astronomical Julian date of the first ""yes"" record of the series (calculated as days and hours since noon on January 1, 4713 BC in the proleptic Julian calendar). Decimal values are truncated (rounded down) to the nearest whole number so they represent noon of the calendar day the observation was made.",
NumDays_Since_Prior_No,"The number of days between the last ""no"" phenophase status record and the first ""yes"" phenophase status record of the series.  A value of ""-9999"" indicates there was not a ""no"" record preceding the first ""yes"" record of the series within the selected time period. ",
Last_Yes_Year,"The year of the last ""yes"" record of the series.",
Last_Yes_Month,"The month of the last ""yes"" record of the series.",
Last_Yes_Day,"The day of the month of the last ""yes"" record of the series.",
Last_Yes_DOY,"The day of year, ranging from 1 to 366, of the last ""yes"" record of the series. ",
Last_Yes_Julian_Date,"The astronomical Julian date of the last ""yes"" record of the series (calculated as days and hours since noon on January 1, 4713 BC in the proleptic Julian calendar). Decimal values are truncated (rounded down) to the nearest whole number so they represent noon of the calendar day the observation was made.",
NumDays_Until_Next_No,"The number of days between the last ""yes"" phenophase status record of the series and the next ""no"" phenophase status record.  A value of ""-9999"" indicates there was not a ""no"" record following the last ""yes"" record of the series within the selected time period. ",
NumYs_in_Series,"The total number of days in the series with a ""yes"" record. ",
NumDays_in_Series,The total number of days in the series.,
Multiple_Observers,"Indicates whether multiple observers contributed records to the series. A value of ""0"" indicates only one observer contributed records, and a value of ""1"" indicates more than one observer contributed records. Multiple observers can contribute observations at a shared group site (http://www.usanpn.org/nn/groups/shared-site).",
Multiple_FirstY,"Indicates whether there are multiple series for the phenophase on the organism within the selected time period. A value of ""0"" indicates there is only one series, and a value of ""1"" indicates there are more than one series within the selected time period. When the selected time period consists of more than one year, calculation of multiple series is separate for each 12-month time span starting from the selected start date. Note that the first ""yes"" record for a 12-month time span during the selected time period might not be preceded by a ""no"" record, but the first ""yes"" for subsequent series within the same 12-month time span is always separated from the previous series by at least one ""no"" record.",
Observed_Status_Conflict_Flag,"Indicates the presence and type of conflict (i.e. reported Phenophase_Status of both ""yes"" and ""no"" for the same observation date) between two or more phenophase status records included in the series. These conflicts can be explored in our status and intensity data type.",MultiObserver-StatusConflict|OneObserver-StatusConflict
AGDD,"Accumulated growing degree days (in degrees Celsius) on the date of the first ""yes"" record of the series. This is the sum of growing degree days (GDD) since January 1st, where GDD is calculated as the number of degrees C by which each day's average temperature exceeds 0 degrees C (i.e., (Tmax + Tmin)/2 - 0 degrees C). From Daymet (http://daymet.ornl.gov).",
AGDD_in_F,"Accumulated growing degree days (in degrees Fahrenheit) on the date of the first ""yes"" record of the series. This is the sum of growing degree days (GDD) since January 1st, where GDD is calculated as the number of degrees F by which each day's average temperature exceeds 32 degrees F (i.e., (Tmax + Tmin)/2 - 32 degrees F). From Daymet (http://daymet.ornl.gov).",
