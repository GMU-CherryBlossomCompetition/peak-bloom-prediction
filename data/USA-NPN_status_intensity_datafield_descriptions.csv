A value of ""-9999"" indicates the site does not fall within the boundaries of North America.",
Species_ID,The unique identifier of the species for which the status record was made.,
Genus,The taxonomic genus of the organism for which the status record was made. Taxonomy follows that in the Integrated Taxonomic Information System (http://itis.gov).,
Species,"The taxonomic species of the organism for which the status record was made. Taxonomy follows that in the Integrated Taxonomic Information System (http://itis.gov). In those rare cases where a taxonomic subspecies or varietal is designated, the subspecies or varietal name is appended to the species name after a hypen (e.g. Cornus florida-appalachianspring).",
Common_Name,"The common name of the species for which the status record was made. Common names for plants follow those in the USDA PLANTS Database (http://plants.usda.gov), and for animals, in the NatureServe database (http://explorer.natureserve.org).",
Kingdom,The taxonomic kingdom of the organism for which the status record was made.,Plantae|Animalia
Individual_ID,"The unique identifier of the individual plant or the animal species at a site for which the status record was made. Note that for plants, individuals are tracked separately, while for animals, the species as a whole (rather than unique individuals) is tracked at a site. More information can be found in the ancillary data file for ""Individual Plant"".",
Phenophase_ID,"The unique identifier of the phenophase for which the status record was made. Note that there can be several names and definitions for a given phenophase as they vary between datasets and can change over time within datasets. All definitions lumped under the same Phenophase_ID are considered equivalent for the purposes of general phenological analysis. More information can be found in the ancillary data files for ""Phenophase"" and ""Phenophase Definition"".",
Phenophase_Category,The overarching life stage category of the phenophase for which the status record was made. Each category includes all phenophases across all plant or animal taxa that target that life stage.,Leaves [for plants]|Flowers [for plants]|Fruits [for plants]|Needles [for plants]|Pollen cones [for plants]|Seed cones [for plants]|Activity [for animals]|Reproduction [for animals]|Development [for animals]|Method [for animals]
Phenophase_Description,"The descriptive title of the phenophase for which the status record was made. This is the overarching title of the phenophase defined by Phenophase_ID, and may include several different names and definitions (as defined in the Phenophase_Name and Phenophase_Definition_ID fields), as these vary between datasets and can change over time within datasets. More information can be found in the ancillary data file for ""Phenophase"".",
Observation_Date,The date the status observation was made in the field.,
Day_of_Year,"The day of year, ranging from 1 to 366, that the status observation was made in the field.",
Phenophase_Status,The status (i.e. presence or absence) of the phenophase at the time the observation was made in the field.,"1 [""yes the phenophase is occuring""]|0 [""no the phenophase is not occuring""]|-1 [""not certain whether the phenophase is occuring""]"
Intensity_Category_ID,"The unique identifier of the intensity category assigned to the phenophase for this species at the time the status observation was made in the field. Intensity measures allow reporting of the degree to which a phenophase is expressed. More information can be found in the ancillary data file for ""Intensity"". A value of ""-9999"" indicates there was no intensity category assigned to this phenophase for this species at the time the observation was made.",
Intensity_Value,"The value reported in response to the intensity category question assigned to the phenophase for this species at the time the status observation was made in the field. The list of allowable responses for this intensity category question can be found in the ancillary data file for ""Intensity"".",
Abundance_Value,"Used only for animal observations, the value reported in response to the instruction, ""enter the number of individual animals observed in this phenophase"".",
AGDD,"Accumulated growing degree days (in degrees Celsius) on the Observation_Date. This is the sum of growing degree days (GDD) since January 1st, where GDD is calculated as the number of degrees C by which each day's average temperature exceeds 0 degrees C (i.e., (Tmax + Tmin)/2 - 0 degrees C). From Daymet (http://daymet.ornl.gov).",
AGDD_in_F,"Accumulated growing degree days (in degrees Fahrenheit) on the Observation_Date. This is the sum of growing degree days (GDD) since January 1st, where GDD is calculated as the number of degrees F by which each day's average temperature exceeds 32 degrees F (i.e., (Tmax + Tmin)/2 - 32 degrees F). From Daymet (http://daymet.ornl.gov).",
